# Unhandled Exceptions in Asynchronous Network Requests
This repository showcases a common error in Dart applications involving asynchronous network requests and provides a solution for improved error handling.

The `bug.dart` file contains the code demonstrating the issue of insufficient exception handling. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a more robust solution. 

## Problem
The initial code doesn't handle all potential exceptions thoroughly, leaving room for unexpected crashes or silent failures.

## Solution
The improved code includes more specific exception handling, giving you better control over how your app responds to various errors encountered during network operations.  The improved error messages provide more context for debugging.
